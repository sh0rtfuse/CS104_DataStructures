Problem 4b Timing Data
Raymond Dam

Trial		Time (loop)		Time (recursion)
1.		2.860000e-04			3.718000e-03
2.		2.850000e-04			3.631000e-03
3.		2.870000e-04			3.426000e-03
4.		2.850000e-04			3.590000e-03
5.		2.860000e-04			3.430000e-03

Overhead between iterative vs. recursive (roughly)

.003718/.000286 = ~13% improvement in the recursive algorithm

NOTES ABOUT THE DATA
- 100,000 data points
- file name "data1.txt"; please place in same directory become enter name at runtime
