Problem 4a Timing Data
Raymond Dam

Trial		Time (loop)		Time (recursion)
1.		3.350000e-04		3.472000e-03
2.		3.330000e-04		3.327000e-03
3.		3.340000e-04		3.443000e-03
4.		3.140000e-04		3.334000e-03
5.		3.340000e-04		3.274000e-03

Overhead between iterative vs. recursive (roughly)

.003472/.000335 = ~10% improvement in the recursive algorithm


NOTES ABOUT THE DATA
- 100,000 data points
- file name "data1.txt"; please place in same directory become enter name at runtime
